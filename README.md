# Customer-Retention-Analysis-and-Churn-Prediction
This is an end-to-end customer retention project designed to predict and analyze churn in the telecom sector. The project begins with SQL-based data preprocessing, handling null values, and exploring customer demographics, geographics, payments, and services data. Next, machine learning models are applied in Python, with Random Forest achieving ~85% accuracy, validated through confusion matrix, classification report, and feature importance analysis. Finally, a two-page Power BI dashboard provides business-oriented insights: an executive summary of historical churn patterns and a prediction page that highlights at-risk customers. The project integrates SQL, Python ML, and BI visualization to deliver actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies in a competitive telecom environment.
